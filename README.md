Contributing
------------

In the spirit of [free software](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html), **everyone** is encouraged to help improve this project.

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

Developers
------------

Know issues in features that need a fix:
* Shop online


* by reporting [bugs](https://github.com/d4x337/reloaded/issues)
* by suggesting new features
* by refactoring code
* by resolving [issues](https://github.com/d4x337/reloaded/issues)
* by writing specifications
* by writing code (*no patch is too small*: fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace)


Non Developers
------------

* by correcting a language translations file. Currently quite all (except Italian and English) need a review
from a mother tongue who is also used to the internet jargon of its own country. Currently are supported Italian,
English, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Chinese, Russian, Portoguese and Spanish.
* by adjusting the design and navigation for a better user experience.
* by translating the english or italian dictionary into a new language
* by writing documentation


Application Security Specialists
------------

* by starting to fix the vulnerabilities reported [here](https://github.com/d4x337/reloaded/brakeman_report_06042019.txt))

DevOps
------------

Some operations are not yet fully automated due to lack of time, resources and focus since the development
of features have been the main point in latest years. Any DevOp who would like to improve the system is encouraged
to do it: you will find a lot of sections to be automated and will be a big reason of satisfaction. 


Encryption Experts
------------

* apply a secrets management system, open like conjour or hishcorp solution.
* find ways to generate complex entropy, like hardware random prime numbers generators.
* review the javascript library code to generate private keys client side.


Project Roadmap
------------

* Finish RestAPI for machine-to-machine communications.
* Apply current design to the WebMail section. 
* New feature for the Social Network side
* Improvements to the Online Shop
* Web Chat using the current design


Technologies
------------
Without a lot of technologies this project wouldn't exist. So I am grateful for all the people and organizations
who worked building the dependencies of Reloaded. I may miss some but i'd to mention PostgreSQL, Ruby, Rails,
JQuery and many others.


Special Thanks
------------

Family, friends, colleagues and to some women that have been my inspiration and strength with their deep love.
I hope to have the change to return your priceless emotive support. Just some names to maintain their privacy, each
one have been very special to me in their own way, no competition or compares because you have been just awesome.
Thank you  Paola, Camilla, Frederique and Kim <3
