  phil_p0: "Information Security today involves a bit all: individuals, companies or organizations in general. We might think that you have already a high level of security and hope that nobody will ever get control of our data but this is not a perfect world and we must defend ourselves. Definately being attacked is not a matter of if but of when."
  phil_p1: "On the defensive plan we do not think that security through obscurity without disclose information system vulnerabilities is the best solution. The philosophy that we support as opposed instead is full-disclosure movement, meaning we trust that full disclosure of vulnerabilities and exploits will force the parties involved to protect themselves from their weaknesses, raising the level of security and contributing to the natural technological evolution of the whole community."
  phil_p2: "With regard to the offensive side of the security we think that the penetration test is very useful to evaluate the real weaknesses of an organization, totally ignoring their perception of safety. Usually all data acquired in these tests are used to 'learn the lesson' and raise defenses."
